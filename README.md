# Comparision of text classifiers
In this notebook I compare 3 methods of text classification:
* logistic regression
* Bayesian methods 
* linear support vector
* decision trees

In addition, I have used the nltk and spacy libraries to analyse texts and show their capabilities in terms of tokenisation, stemming and lemmatisation.
